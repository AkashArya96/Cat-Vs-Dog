# Cat-Vs-Dog

# Cat vs Dog Classification

This project focuses on training a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs accurately. The goal is to build a model that can differentiate between the two animal classes with high precision.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle. It contains thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs, ensuring a diverse range of examples for training the model.

## Preprocessing

Before training the model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps:

- Image resizing: All images are resized to a consistent size of 256x256 pixels to ensure uniformity.
- Normalization: Pixel values are normalized to a range between 0 and 1.
- Augmentation: To increase the variety of training examples, data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, flips, and zooms are applied.

## Model Architecture

For this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is used. Transfer learning is employed by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a large image dataset, such as Sequential. The pre-trained model provides a solid foundation for feature extraction, while the final layers are customized for cat vs dog classification.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The dataset is split into training and validation sets. The model is trained on the training set using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the classification error. The validation set is used to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting. The model's effectiveness is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is also visualized to gain insights into the model's performance.
